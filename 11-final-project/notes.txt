Main Idea: Short videogame about night being forever.
Artstyle: completly black and white, with shades of gray

e.preventDefault(); <-- Code which prevents scroll wheel

CURRENT GOALS AND STUFF ( In no particular order ) # of question marks = how uncertain
--------------
1. Make person move with not that much code --> Make smoother next
2. Figure out animation to go from room to room --> Make it --> Incorpate it
2. Ideas: Blacksweep from side entering from, when covers entire screen: change out scene / Or some manner using moonlight
3. Enchance Main Menu & get a start button to work
3. A: Include moon or moonlight rays that are animated, when over title make easier to be seen (make it so rays are "lower" than the text, should work)
4. Death Animation
5. Design Rooms, (Starter, Hallway, Etc)
6. Puzzle Ideas
7. Boss Fight???
8. Color Change mechanics?
9. Animate anything else significant and not mentioned
10. Come up with ideas on how to block / mitigate the moonlight
10. Ideas: Curtains/Shades, Opaque objects, Lantern
11. Come up with an ending, story in general
12. Figure out way to show controls to player / Option Menu & show other mechanics off
12. Ideas: Clear (Control Menu is acessed early on, clear instructions) 
Semi-Clear (Controls are learned in tandem with a puzzle, showing buttons)
Hidden (No controls are showed at all, player learns on their own)
13. Difficulty (Changes the controls introduction, ease of death, timed challanges??) Easy, Medium, Hard
14. Music (Using Tonejs)
15 Lantern (Can hold off monsters, and moonlight) Limited in some way (15,10)
16. Monsters? (Method of defeat: Lantern) Make movement smoother to easier deal with them
17. Pixelate player if possible
